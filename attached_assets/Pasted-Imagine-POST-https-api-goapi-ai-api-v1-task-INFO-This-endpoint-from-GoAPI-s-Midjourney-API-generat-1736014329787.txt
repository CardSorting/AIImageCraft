Imagine
POST
https://api.goapi.ai/api/v1/task
INFO
This endpoint from GoAPI's Midjourney API generates 4 unique images in a 2x2 grid from a text description also known as prompt. This endpoint corresponds with the /imagine command from the offical Midjourney.

Mode Selection
Please use the process_mode parameter to select modes (please refrain from using the in-prompt-mode to select modes).

Below are rules about mode selection:

1.
If the process mode is not specified, system will default to the in-prompt-mode. If the in-prompt-mode is also not specified, then the system default is relax mode. For example:

1.
If process mode = "" and in-prompt-mode = relax ---> will use relax

2.
If process mode = "" and in-prompt-mode = fast ---> will use fast

3.
If process mode = "" and in-prompt-mode = unspecified ---> will use relax

2.
Process mode overrides in-prompt-mode; for example:

1.
If process mode = fast and in-prompt-mode = relax ---> will use fast

2.
If process mode = relax and in-prompt-mode = fast ---> will use relax

3.
For BYOA users, rules will apply depending on the available resource of your Midjourney account(s). For example:

1.
Fast or turbo jobs will be routed to any accounts with available fast hours. If none is available, the job will be processed as a relax job on any accounts with relax GPU time.

2.
Relax jobs will be routed to any accounts that is not on the Basic Plan (the $10 plan) because this plan has no relax GPU time. If none is available, then an error will be returned.

3.
If your only Midjourney account's account setting is relax, then all the jobs processed by this account will be relax mode regardless mode selection from GoAPI. Also, when you set your Midjourney account to relax mode, we will not use it for any fast job, and this might result in wasted fast hours.

4.
If your Midjourney account's setting is fast, then all jobs will be processed as per mode selection from GoAPI. When your Midjourney account runs out of fast hours, we will automatically change that account's setting to relax.

Note:

Endpoints such as upscale, variation, outpaint, and pan donâ€™t support process mode. Instead, they inherit the process mode from the parent task automatically.
